Rexster is configured through an "XML configuration file":http://github.com/tinkerpop/rexster/blob/master/src/main/resources/com/tinkerpop/rexster/rexster.xml with overriding command line options.

h3. XML Configuration

The XML configuration file has a basic structure as follows:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<rexster>
    <base-uri>http://localhost</base-uri>
    <webserver-port>8182</webserver-port>
    <adminserver-port>8183</adminserver-port>
    <cache-maxsize>1000</cache-maxsize>
    <web-root>public</web-root>
    <web-server-configuration>
        <com.sun.jersey.config.property.packages>com.tinkerpop.rexster</com.sun.jersey.config.property.packages>
        <com.tinkerpop.rexster.config>rexster.xml</com.tinkerpop.rexster.config>
    </web-server-configuration>
    <admin-server-configuration>
        <com.tinkerpop.rexster.config>rexster.xml</com.tinkerpop.rexster.config>
    </admin-server-configuration>
    <graphs>
      <graph>
        <graph-name>gratefulgraph</graph-name>
	<graph-type>com.tinkerpop.rexster.config.TinkerGraphGraphConfiguration</graph-type>
        <graph-file>data/graph-example-2.xml</graph-file>
        <read-only>false</read-only>
        <packages-allowed>gremlin;grateful</packages-allowed>
      </graph>
      ...
    </graphs>
</rexster>
```

The @<cache-maxsize>@ element configures the size of the object cache as described here in [[Cached Results]].  The @<webserver-port>@ allows configuration of the port on which Rexster will serve.  The @<adminserver-port>@ allows configuration of the port on which the administration web site will be served and the @<web-root>@ allows specification of the directory where the root of administration web site web site exists.  It is important to note that this feature is currently under development and not complete (in its current state, it has only been tested with Google Chrome).  

The @<web-server-configuration>@ and @<admin-server-configuration>@ elements contain a collection of properties passed to the Jersey runtime and administration server on initialization.  The key element in the set for @<web-server-configuration>@ is the @<com.sun.jersey.config.property.packages>@ element which should contain a semi-colon separated list of packages which inform Jersey where to search for resource classes.  In both cases, @<web-server-configuration>@ and @<admin-server-configuration>@ take a @<com.tinkerpop.rexster.config>@ that contains a pointer to the place where graph configurations exist.  Currently, while admittedly redundant, this value should point to @rexster.xml@ itself.

The @<graphs>@ element will contain any number of @<graph>@ configurations.  Each @<graph>@ element will equate to one graph being configured within Rexster.  The exact contents of the @<graph>@ element is dependent upon the type of graph implementation ("OrientDB":http://www.orientechnologies.com/, "neo4j":http://neo4j.org/, etc.) utilized.  However, some key general rules exist for all graph configurations

* The @<graph-name>@ element must be unique within the list of configured graphs.  
* The @<graph-enabled>@ element may be applied to any @<graph>@.  Setting its contents to "false" will prevent that graph from loading to Rexster.  If the element is not present at all (or set explicitly to true) the graph will be loaded.
* The @<graph-type>@ element is the full name of a class that implements the @GraphConfiguration@ interface.  The @GraphConfiguration@ is responsible for using the properties supplied to it from the configuration file to produce a fully configured @Graph@ instance.  This approach allows a plug-in approach to providing new support for Graph implementations without requiring access to Rexster code.  In addition to explicitly specifying the class name, the value of @graph-type@ may contain one of several out-of-the-box options: "tinkergraph", "orientgraph", "neo4jgraph", "memorystoresailgraph", "nativestoresailgraph", and "neo4jsailgraph".  Please read the configuration options for each of these defined below for more information on the configuration options expected for each type.
* The @<read-only>@ element will configure a graph so that its data cannot be modified.  Set to true to enable this feature.  If the element is not present graphs will default this value to false.
* The @<packages-allowed>@ element refers to the traversal suites that are exposed. They must be separated by a semi-colon. These are dynamically loaded using the ServiceLoader model allowing drop in of a new @Traversal@ to Rexster without having to edit the code base.  The @Traversal@ implementation just needs to be in the class path. 

Packages must be explicitly defined for traversals to be exposed with several basic options for configuration:
* If this property is left blank, no traversals will be configured. 
* If this property is given the assignment of a single semi-colon, it will be configured with root traversal services (ie. gremlin).  
* If this property is configured with other named packages, a blank package should be established (ie. <packages-allowed>;grateful</packages-allowed) to expose root traversal services.

The following sections define the common settings for each available graph type:

h4. TinkerGraph

A "TinkerGraph":http://wiki.github.com/tinkerpop/gremlin/tinkergraph would be configured as follows:

```xml
<graph>
  <graph-name>gratefulgraph</graph-name>
  <graph-type>tinkergraph</graph-type>
  <graph-file>data/graph-example-2.xml</graph-file>
  <packages-allowed>gremlin;grateful</packages-allowed>
</graph>
```

The @<graph-type>@ could also be explicitly specified as:

```text
<graph-type>com.tinkerpop.rexster.config.TinkerGraphGraphConfiguration</graph-type>
```

The @<graph-file>@ element contains the path to a GraphML file.

h4. Neo4j

A "Neo4j":http://neo4j.org/ graph would be configured as follows:

```xml
<graph>
  <graph-name>neo4jsample</graph-name>
  <graph-type>neo4jgraph</graph-type>
  <graph-file>/tmp/rexster-graph</graph-file>
  <packages-allowed></packages-allowed>
  <properties>
    <!-- Memory mapped I/O settings -->
    <!-- For high traversal speed it is important to have the nodestore.db and relationshipstore.db files. -->
    <neostore.nodestore.db.mapped_memory>285M</neostore.nodestore.db.mapped_memory>
    <neostore.relationshipstore.db.mapped_memory>285M</neostore.relationshipstore.db.mapped_memory>
    <neostore.propertystore.db.mapped_memory>100M</neostore.propertystore.db.mapped_memory>
    <neostore.propertystore.db.strings.mapped_memory>100M</neostore.propertystore.db.strings.mapped_memory>
    <neostore.propertystore.db.arrays.mapped_memory>10M</neostore.propertystore.db.arrays.mapped_memory>
    <neostore.propertystore.db.index.mapped_memory>10M</neostore.propertystore.db.index.mapped_memory>
    <neostore.propertystore.db.index.keys.mapped_memory>10M</neostore.propertystore.db.index.keys.mapped_memory>
    ...
    </properties>
</graph>
```

The @<graph-type>@ could also be explicitly specified as:

```text
<graph-type>com.tinkerpop.rexster.config.Neo4jGraphConfiguration</graph-type>
```

The @<properties>@ element contains neo4j specific configuration values.  Any entries placed here will be converted to name/value pairs to be passed into neo4j for its configuration.  Set any properties here as would have been done in a neo4j.properties file.

h4. Sail

There are several "Sail":http://www.openrdf.org/doc/sesame2/2.3.0/users/ch08.html configurations available: Memory Store, Native Store and Neo4J.

h5. Memory Store

```xml
<graph>
  <graph-name>sailsample</graph-name>
  <graph-type>memorystoresailgraph</graph-type>
  <graph-file>data/graph-example-1.ntriple</graph-file>
  <packages-allowed></packages-allowed>
</graph>
```

The @<graph-type>@ could also be explicitly specified as:

```text
<graph-type>com.tinkerpop.rexster.config.MemoryStoreSailGraphConfiguration</graph-type>
```

The @<graph-file>@ element is the data file containing the Sail data which will be loaded to Rexster .  This value may be empty for the MemoryStoreSailGraph implementation only.

h5. Native Store Sail Graph

```xml
<graph>
  <graph-name>sailsample</graph-name>
  <graph-type>nativestoresailgraph</graph-type>
  <graph-file>tmp/data/sail</graph-file>
  <packages-allowed></packages-allowed>
</graph>
```

The @<graph-type>@ could also be explicitly specified as:

```text
<graph-type>com.tinkerpop.rexster.config.NativeStoreSailGraphConfiguration</graph-type>
```

The @<graph-file>@ element is location of the directory containing the Sail data which will be loaded to Rexster .  This value is a required element of configuration.

h5. Neo4j Sail Graph

```xml
<graph>
  <graph-name>sailsample</graph-name>
  <graph-type>neo4jsailgraph</graph-type>
  <graph-file>tmp/data/sail</graph-file>
  <packages-allowed></packages-allowed>
</graph>
```

The @<graph-type>@ could also be explicitly specified as:

```text
<graph-type>com.tinkerpop.rexster.config.Neo4jSailGraphConfiguration</graph-type>
```

The @<graph-file>@ element is location of the directory containing the Sail data which will be loaded to Rexster .  This value is a required element of configuration.

h4. OrientDB

An "OrientDB":http://www.orientechnologies.com/ graph would be configured as follows:

```xml
<graph>
  <graph-name>orientdbsample</graph-name>
  <graph-type>orientgraph</graph-type>
  <graph-file>local:C:/data/graph/graph</graph-file>
  <packages-allowed></packages-allowed>
  <properties>
    <username>admin</username>
    <password>admin</password>
  </properties>
</graph>
```

The @<graph-type>@ could also be explicitly specified as:

```text
<graph-type>com.tinkerpop.rexster.config.OrientGraphConfiguration</graph-type>
```

The @<graph-file>@ element is the URL to the OrientDB database Rexster is expected to connect to.  The @<properties>@ element requires two elements @<username>@ and @<password>@ to access the OrientDB graph instance.  

h3. Command Line Overrides

When starting Rexster from the command line using:

```text
rexster.sh
```

there are several options available to override values supplied in the @rexster.xml@ file:

* @webserverport@ - Overrides the @webserver-port@ configuration value.
* @adminserverport@ - Overrides the @adminserver-port@ configuration value.
* @cachemaxsize@ - Overrides the @cache-maxsize@ configuration value.
* @webroot@ - Overrides the @web-root@ configuration value.
* @configuration@ - Supplies the @rexster.xml@ file to use for configuration.
* @help@ - Outputs a description of the command line options available.

Executing the following command:

```text
rexster.sh -help
```

would yield:

```text
usage: rexster
 -adminserverport <port>    override port used for adminserver-port in
                            rexster.xml
 -cachemaxsize <max-size>   override cache-maxsize in rexster.xml
 -configuration <file>      use given file for rexster.xml
 -help                      print this message
 -webroot <path>            override web-root in rexster.xml
 -webserverport <port>      override port used for webserver-port in
                            rexster.xml
```
