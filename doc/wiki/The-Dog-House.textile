Rexster's Dog House is a browser-based interface to Rexster and currently provides the following functions:

* Vertex and Edge Browser - View vertices and edges for a selected graph.
* Gremlin Console - Simulates a Gremlin console session against a selected graph.

h2. Getting Started

Start the Rexster Web Server as described on the [[Getting Started]] page, using:

```text
rexster-start.sh
```

[[Configuration|Rexster Configuration]] related to the Dog House are found in the @rexster.xml@ file.  Given the default configuration, The Dog House can be accessed at:

```text
http://localhost:8183
```

h2. Vertex and Edge Browser

The Vertex and Edge Browser lists the graphs that are configured within Rexster.  Rexster will only shows those graphs which are marked as enabled within the configuration.  Selecting a graph yields the opportunity to browse vertices or edges.  A pager at the top and bottom of the browse panel listing vertices or edges allows one to cycle through the listing and the multi-cornered arrow button within each drills through to a detailed view of that element.  From there it is possible to see other graph elements associated with the one selected.

h2. Gremlin Console

The Gremlin Console looks to simulate a Gremlin session within the browser.  First, ensure that the appropriate graph is selected so that Gremlin scripts are evaluated against the right graph.  Like the Vertex and Edge Browser, the graph listing only includes graphs that are marked as enabled within the configuration.  Once the correct graph is selected, simply use the console as one would use Gremlin in a terminal session.

It is important to note that the Gremlin Console in The Dog House will only accept single line statements.  For example:

```text
gremlin> for(int i=0; i<10; i++) { 
gremlin>   println i; 
gremlin> }
```

would need to be written as:

```text
gremlin> for(int i=0; i<10; i++) { println i; }
```

h2. Limitations

The Dog House works best with "Google Chrome":http://www.google.com/chrome/ 8 or better, but has been shown to work well with "Firefox":http://www.mozilla.com/ 3.6.13+/4.
