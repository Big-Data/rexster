h3. Limitations

As The Dog House is still a bit experimental, the following limitations should be considered when using it:

* The Dog House works best with "Google Chrome":http://www.google.com/chrome/ 8 or better, but has been shown to work well with "Firefox":http://www.mozilla.com/ 3.6.13.
* The Dog House is hard-coded to work against the default Rexster port of 8182.  As a temporary fix, it is possible to point The Dog House at a different port by opening the "server.js":https://github.com/tinkerpop/rexster/blob/master/src/main/javascript/rexster/server.js file, changing the value of the URI and rebuilding Rexster.
