Rexster is a "RESTful":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer shell to a "Blueprints":http://blueprints.tinkerpop.com graph.[1] This "HTTP":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol "web service":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_service provides standard low-level GET, POST, and DELETE methods, access to stored graph traversals, support for adhoc graph queries through "Gremlin":http://gremlin.tinkerpop.com and a browser-based interface called [[The Dog House]]. While any graph traversal can be evaluated through Rexster, the engine provides extensive support for search-, score-, rank- and, ultimately, recommendation-based traversals.
