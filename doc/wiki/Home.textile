Rexster is a multi-faceted graph server that exposes any "Blueprints":http://blueprints.tinkerpop.com graph (e.g. "TinkerGraph":https://github.com/tinkerpop/blueprints/wiki/TinkerGraph, "Neo4j":http://neo4j.org, "OrientDB":http://www.orientechnologies.com/orient-db.htm, "DEX":http://www.sparsity-technologies.com/dex, and "Sail RDF Stores":http://www.openrdf.org) through several mechanisms with a general focus on "REST":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer. This "HTTP":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol "web service":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_service provides standard low-level GET, POST, and DELETE methods, a flexible extension model which allows plug-in like development for external services (such as adhoc graph queries through "Gremlin":http://gremlin.tinkerpop.com), and a browser-based interface called [[The Dog House]]. [[Extensions]] support standard traversal goals such as search, score, rank, and, in concert, recommendation.[1]  [[Rexster Console]] makes it possible to do remote script evaluation against configured graphs inside of a Rexster Server.
