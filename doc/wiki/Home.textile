Rexster provides a "RESTful":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer shell to any "Blueprints":http://blueprints.tinkerpop.com enabled graph database (e.g. TinkerGraph, "Neo4j":http://neo4j.org, "OrientDB":http://www.orientechnologies.com/orient-db.htm, "DEX":http://www.sparsity-technologies.com/dex, and "Sail RDF Stores":http://www.openrdf.org). This "HTTP":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol "web service":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_service provides standard low-level GET, POST, and DELETE methods, a flexible extension model which allows plug-in like development for external services (such as adhoc graph queries through "Gremlin":http://gremlin.tinkerpop.com), and a browser-based interface called [[The Dog House]]. [[Extensions]] support standard traversal goals such as search, score, rank, and, in concert, recommendation.[1]  

Please join the Gremlin users group at "http://groups.google.com/group/gremlin-users":http://groups.google.com/group/gremlin-users for all "TinkerPop":http://tinkerpop.com related discussions.
