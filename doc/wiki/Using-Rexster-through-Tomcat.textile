Rexster makes use of the "Jersey REST framework":http://jersey.java.net/ and comes with an example "web.xml":https://github.com/tinkerpop/rexster/blob/master/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml for including Rexster within Tomcat.

The following steps describe the fast path to getting Rexster (with the included sample graphs) to run in a default instance of Tomcat:

# Build Rexster with Maven.  The Rexster "pom.xml":https://github.com/tinkerpop/rexster/blob/master/pom.xml will produce a WAR file in the target folder when built.  
# Copy the WAR to the Tomcat @webapps@ directory.
# Copy the @data@ directory from Rexster to the Tomcat @bin@ folder.
# The Rexster instance will serve at @http://localhost:8080/{rexster-webapp-name}@ where the @rexster-webapp-name@ is the name of the WAR file (ie. rexster-0.2-SNAPSHOT). 

The example "web.xml":https://github.com/tinkerpop/rexster/blob/master/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml does not include configuration for the Rexster Administration Tool at this time as it is still an experimental feature.
