Rexster helps provide API documentation to users of the extension in two ways.  First, Rexster will show what extensions are properly configured and available from a particular URI as well as how to access them.  Second, Rexster can display API documentation for a specific service as part of error message generation.

h1. Hypermedia

When accessing a URI [[extension point|Extension Points]], the list of properly configured extensions will be displayed.  Accessing this URI with the "Sample Kibbles:https://github.com/tinkerpop/rexster-kibbles/tree/master/sample-kibbles [[configured|Deploying an Extension]]:

```text
http://localhost:8182/graphs/tinkergraph/
```

will yield:

```javascript
{
  "version":"*.*",
  "name":"tinkergraph",
  "graph":"tinkergraph[vertices:6 edges:6]",
  "readOnly":false,
  "type":"com.tinkerpop.blueprints.pgm.impls.tg.TinkerGraph",
  "queryTime":0.955418,
  "upTime":"0[d]:00[h]:13[m]:24[s]",
  "extensions":[
    {"title":"evaluate an ad-hoc Gremlin script for a graph.","href":"tp\/gremlin"},
    {"title":"returns the configuration as JSON.","href":"tp-sample\/map-config"},
    {"title":"a simple ping extension.","href":"tp-sample\/ping"},
    {"title":"returns the results of the toString() method on the graph.","href":"tp-sample\/simple-path\/some-work"},
    {"title":"returns the results of the toString() method on the edge.","href":"tp-sample\/simple-path\/other-work"},
    {"title":"returns the results of the toString() method on the graph.","href":"tp-sample\/simple-root"}
  ]
}
```

Note that @extensions@ attribute which contains an array of configured extensions.  The value for the @title@ property comes from the value of the @description@ parameter supplied to @@ExtensionDescriptor@.  The @href@ property defines the relative path to that extension from that base URI.  

In the event that the extension is not properly configured in some way, it will not appear in this list.

h1. API Documentation

When a failure occurs, it is nice to show to the user what the expectations are for the extension and its basic API.  Rexster helps with this in a few ways: parameter descriptions, explicit description and a combination of the two.  

h2. Parameter Description

A @description@ parameter can be supplied to the @ExtensionRequestParameter@.  Consider this code snippet from the @PingExtension@ in the "Sample Kibbles":https://github.com/tinkerpop/rexster-kibbles/tree/master/sample-kibbles project:

```java
public ExtensionResponse evaluatePing(@RexsterContext RexsterResourceContext context,
                                      @RexsterContext Graph graph,
                                      @ExtensionRequestParameter(name="reply", description="a value to reply with") String reply) 
```

When accessing the following URI (forgetting to include the @reply@ URI query string parameter):

```text
http://localhost:8182/graphs/tinkergraph/tp-sample/ping
```

Rexster will provide the following response:

```javascript
{
  "message":"the reply parameter cannot be empty",
  "api":{
    "description":"a simple ping extension.",
    "parameters":[{"reply":"a value to reply with"}]
  },
  "success":false}
```

Note that the @reply@ parameter is injected into the @api.parameters@ along with the value from the @description@ parameter.  It is possible to get the @api@ JSON fragment from the @ExtensionMethod@ using the @getExtensionApiAsJson@ method. 

h2. Explicit Description

If for some reason the extension is not using @@ExtensionRequestParameter@ annotations (perhaps the extension simply extracts the extension parameters from one of the context objects directly), the extension can provide its documentation directly through the @@ExtensionDescriptor@ annotation.  Simply supply an array of @@ExtensionApi@ annotations to the @api@ parameter of the @@ExtensionDescriptor@.

Given the following sample:

```java
@ExtensionDescriptor(description = "some extension i wrote for gremlin",
                     api = {
                         @ExtensionApi(parameterName = "script", description = "the Gremlin script to be evaluated"),
                         @ExtensionApi(parameterName = "xyz", description = "a fake parameter")
                     })
```

the returned JSON with @api@ attribute would look like:

```javascript
{
  "message":null,
  "api":{
    "description":"some extension i wrote for gremlin",
    "parameters":[
      {"script":"the Gremlin script to be evaluated"}, 
      {"xyz":"a fake parameter"}
    ]
  },
  "success":false}
```

h2. Combined

It is possible to use both the parameter-based description as well as the explicit description together.  By default, Rexster will try to use explicit description first and the override existing keys with values from the parameter description first.  That behavior can be controlled by setting the @apiBehavior@ property on the @@ExtensionDescriptor@ annotation.
