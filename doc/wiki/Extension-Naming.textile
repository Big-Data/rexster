Extension naming plays an important role in how the extension is exposed within Rexster.  Extension names are defined through the @ExtensionNaming@ annotation which applies to a class.  The annotation takes two parameters: the @namespace@ and @name@.  Consider the following example:

```java
@ExtensionNaming(name = "myextension", namespace = "ns")
```

The @namespace@ specifies the "package" within which the extension will serve and really behaves as a means for organizing common extensions.  If the @namespace@ is not specified, it will be defaulted to the "global" namespace which is specified as "g".  Therefore, the following annotations are equivalent:

```java
@ExtensionNaming(name = "myextension", namespace = "g")
@ExtensionNaming(name = "myextension")
```

The @name@ parameter refers to the name of the extension itself.  The @name@ should be unique within the @namespace@.  Rexster will not complain of naming collisions, so therefore it is important to examine both the approach to naming as well as the configuration within Rexster of individual extensions per graph.

The values supplied to the @@ExtensionName@ annotation directly define the the extension URI given a particular [[extension point | Extension Points]].  Therefore, assuming a particular graph configured the an extension with the following @@ExtensionNaming@ annotation:

```java
@ExtensionNaming(name = "myextension", namespace = "ns")
```

The above annotation would expose that extension on the following base URIs depending upon the extension point:

```text
# graph extension point
http://{base}/{graph}/ns/myextension

# vertex extension point
http://{base}/{graph}/vertices/{id}/ns/myextension

# edge extension point
http://{base}/{graph}/edges/{id}/ns/myextension
```

Please refer to the [[Rexster Configuration]] section for explanation as to how extensions can be configured to work with graphs given the @name@ and @namespace@ parameters on the @@ExtensionNaming@ annotation.
