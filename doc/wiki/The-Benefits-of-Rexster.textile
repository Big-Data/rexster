Before diving into Rexster, its good to know what Rexster was designed for and what potential use it can serve. The following itemization provides a collection of reasons for using Rexster.

* Rexster allows developers to communicate with "Blueprints-enabled":http://blueprints.tinkerpop.com graphs in a language agnostic fashion. Blueprints is a Java API for graph databases. By using Rexster, the Blueprints API is exposed over HTTP/REST.
* Rexster allows any Blueprints-enabled graph to exist as a standalone server. Thus, multiple clients communicate with the same graph database through Rexster.
* Rexster provides developer friendly classes that support common graph use cases such as searching, ranking, and recommendation.
* Rexster provides ad-hoc queries through the graph-based programming language "Gremlin":http://gremlin.tinkerpop.com.
