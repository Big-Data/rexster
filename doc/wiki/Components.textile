Rexster is intended to be deployed as a standalone server. Various applications can leverage a Rexster instance in order to get the results of triggered traversals. In order to make Rexster useful to these applications, its necessary to ensure that the following components exist.

# *Graph dataset*: this is called the domain model and it is represented in a "graph database":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database. Rexset supports "Blueprints-enabled":http://blueprints.tinkerpop.com graph databases.
# *Collection of traversals*: these are domain specific algorithms that are identified by a URI.
  ** Traversals can be represented using "Pipes":http://pipes.tinkerpop.com.
  ** Usually a collection of reusable domain specific pipes are recomposed for different traversals.

Once these components are properly set up within Rexster, then Rexster is ready to serve results to application requests. Moreover, Rexster provides low-level reading/writing operations of the underlying Blueprints graph database through REST (see [[Basic REST API]]).
