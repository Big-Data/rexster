Rexster is started and stopped through a command line interface.  The starting and stopping of Rexster is managed through two scripts, @rexster-start.sh@ and @rexster-stop.sh@.  When Rexster is started, it listens on a [[configurable port|Rexster Configuration]] (port 8184 by default) for shutdown requests.  When it receives that request, it will properly release resources and stop serving.

h1. Starting Rexster

When starting Rexster from the command line using:

```text
rexster-start.sh
```

there are several options available:

* @-rp@, @--rexsterport@ - Overrides the @rexster-server-port@ configuration value in @rexster.xml@.  This value is 8182 by default.
* @-dp@, @--doghouseport@ - Overrides the @adminserver-port@ configuration value in @rexster.xml@.  This value is 8183 by default.
* @-wr@, @--webroot@ - Overrides the @web-root@ configuration value in @rexster.xml@.
* @-c@, @--configuration@ - Supplies the @rexster.xml@ file to use for configuration.  If this value is not specified, Rexster will try to get use the com.tinkerpop.rexster.rexster.xml resource.
* @--debug@ - When this flag is included on the command line, log messages from Jersey are no longer suppressed.  May be useful when developing Rexster itself or building [[Extensions]].
* @-h@, @--help@ - When this flag is supplied on the command line, Rexster outputs a description of the command line options available.  Rexster will not start when help is requested.

h1. Stopping Rexster

When stopping Rexster from the command line using:

```text
rexster-stop.sh
```

there are several options available: 

* @host@ - The host/IP address to which the shutdown command will be issued.  Shutdown will assume @127.0.0.1@ if the parameter is not specified.
* @port@ - The port on the @host@ to which the shutdown command will be issued.  Shutdown will assume @8184@ if the parameter is not specified.
* @cmd@ - The shutdown command is "s" and will be defaulted as such if not specified.
* @help@ - When this flag is supplied on the command line, a description of the command line options is displayed.  A command to stop Rexster will not be issued when help is requested.

The following command would issue a stop message to a Rexster server listening on @192.168.0.123@ and port @7788@.

```text
rexster-stop.sh -host 192.168.0.123 -port 7788
```
