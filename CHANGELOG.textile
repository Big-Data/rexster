h3. Version 0.3 (Dog Eat Dog -- May 8, 2011)

```xml
 <dependency>
  <groupId>com.tinkerpop</groupId>
  <artifactId>rexster</artifactId>
  <version>0.3</version>
</dependency>
```

* Minor changes to rexster.xml:
** Addition of the @<base-uri>@ element.
** Renaming of @<webserver-port>@ to @<rexster-server-port>@.
** Renaming of @<adminserver-port>@ to @<doghouse-server-port>@.
** Removed some redundancy where rexster.xml had to reference itself within intialization parameters.
* The port to which the Dog House connects for REST services is no longer hardcoded and is configurable given the changes to rexster.xml defined above.
* Supports "DEX":http://www.sparsity-technologies.com/dex graph database.
* Neo4jSail is no longer supported within Rexster and Blueprints.
* Blueprints added a @count@ method to indices.  That function is exposed via @http://localhost/graph/indices/myindex/count?key=name&value=val@
* Introducing the new extension model.  The Gremlin traversal has been converted to the extension model.  Traversals have all been removed from Rexster.
* The following REST API parameters have a new format:
** @rexster.show_types@ is now @rexster.showTypes@
** @rexster.return_keys@ is now @rexster.returnKeys@
** @rexster.allow_cached@ is now @rexster.allowCached@
* The following standard properties contained within the JSON response have been reformatted:
** @up_time@ is now @upTime@
** @query_time@ is now @queryTime@
** @read_only@ is now @readOnly@
* Arrays are now serialized to JSON in the same fashion as Lists.
* Requesting an index resource without parameters will return information about that index instead of a Bad Request status code.
* Removed built-in caching functions.
* New command line "debug" option for Rexster server which will turn on all logging of the underlying Jersey/Grizzly server.
* Remote shutdown.
* Paging model changed in The Dog House.  There is no longer a "Move Last" button when paging through vertices and edges.
* Prefix resource for @SailGraph@ implementations.

```xml
 <dependency>
  <groupId>com.tinkerpop</groupId>
  <artifactId>rexster</artifactId>
  <version>0.2</version>
</dependency>

* Fixed problem with @return_key@ parameter on a Gremlin Traversal from causing an error.
* The @return_keys@ option will now only filter out non-metadata values.
* Rexster operational when deployed within Tomcat after the conversion from Restlet to Jersey.
* Fixed problem where specifying a start offset without an end offset was not returning all records from the start to the unspecified end of the list.
* Fixed problem where specifying a single @return_key@ was returning all properties.
* Command line options for overriding configuration options in @rexster.xml@.
* Graphs configured in @rexster.xml@ have a @<read-only>@ option.
* Added a Gremlin console to The Dog House.
* Added vertex and edge property pages to The Dog House such that it is now possible to traverse the graph textually.
