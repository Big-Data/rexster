Rexster is a multi-faceted graph server that exposes any "Blueprints":http://blueprints.tinkerpop.com graph through several mechanisms with a general focus on REST. Extensions support standard traversal goals such as search, score, rank, and, in concert, recommendation. Rexster makes extensive use of "Blueprints":http://blueprints.tinkerpop.com, "Pipes":http://pipes.tinkerpop.com, and "Gremlin":http://gremlin.tinkerpop.com. In this way its possible to run Rexster over various graph systems including:

  * Implementations:
  ** "TinkerGraph":http://wiki.github.com/tinkerpop/gremlin/tinkergraph in-memory graph
  ** "Neo4j":http://neo4j.org/ graph database
  ** "OrientDB":http://www.orientechnologies.com/ graph database
  ** "DEX":http://www.sparsity-technologies.com/dex graph database
  ** "Sesame 2.0":http://www.openrdf.org compliant RDF stores
  **** "MemoryStore":http://www.openrdf.org/doc/sesame2/users/ch08.html#d0e705, "NativeStore":http://www.openrdf.org/doc/sesame2/users/ch08.html#d0e746, "LinkedDataSail":http://code.google.com/p/ripple/wiki/LinkedDataSail

Rexster provides a browser-based user interface known as "The Dog House":https://github.com/tinkerpop/rexster/wiki/The-Dog-House. This interface allows for viewing vertices, edges, and their related properties. It also includes a console for executing "Gremlin":http://gremlin.tinkerpop.com scripts.

Rexster also includes "Rexster Console":https://github.com/tinkerpop/rexster/wiki/Rexster-Console which allows remote evaluation of scripts within the Rexster Server context.
