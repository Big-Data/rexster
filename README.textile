Rexster is a RESTful graph shell that exposes any "Blueprints":http://blueprints.tinkerpop.com graph through a standalone HTTP server. Extensions support standard traversal goals such as search, score, rank, and, in concert, recommendation. Rexster makes extensive use of "Blueprints":http://blueprints.tinkerpop.com, "Pipes":http://pipes.tinkerpop.com, and "Gremlin":http://gremlin.tinkerpop.com. In this way its possible to run Rexster over various graph systems including:

* "TinkerGraph":http://wiki.github.com/tinkerpop/gremlin/tinkergraph in-memory graph
* "Neo4j":http://neo4j.org/ graph database
* "OrientDB":http://www.orientechnologies.com/ graph database
* "Sesame 2.0":http://www.openrdf.org compliant RDF stores
  ** "MemoryStore":http://www.openrdf.org/doc/sesame2/users/ch08.html#d0e705, "NativeStore":http://www.openrdf.org/doc/sesame2/users/ch08.html#d0e746, "Neo4jSail":http://components.neo4j.org/neo4j-rdf-sail/
