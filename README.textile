Rexster is a graph-based ranking engine that makes use of graph traversals to rank and score elements in a graph. An HTTP-based web service interface provides language agnostic connectivity and the ability to run Rexster as a standalone server. Rexster makes extensive use of "Blueprints":http://blueprints.tinkerpop.com, "Pipes":http://pipes.tinkerpop.com, and "Gremlin":http://gremlin.tinkerpop.com. In this way its possible to run Rexster over various graph systems including:

* "TinkerGraph":http://wiki.github.com/tinkerpop/gremlin/tinkergraph in-memory property graph
* "Neo4j":http://neo4j.org/ graph database
* "Sesame 2.0":http://www.openrdf.org/ compliant RDF stores
